#Dataset Description
The Affordable Rental Housing Developments dataset contains information about affordable rental housing developments in Chicago, including the location, number of units, and income requirements for each development. The dataset includes information on developments funded by the Chicago Department of Housing and other organizations.

#Analysis
I analyzed the distribution of affordable housing developments in Chicago using Python, focusing on the number of developments per community area. Here are the key findings from my analysis:

#The dataset contains information on 874 affordable housing developments in Chicago.
The average number of affordable housing developments per community area is 7.27, with a standard deviation of 6.12.
The community area with the highest number of affordable housing developments is Community Area 23 (South Deering), with 38 developments. The community area with the lowest number of affordable housing developments is Community Area 9 (Edison Park), with only 1 development.
The distribution of affordable housing developments is positively skewed, with a few community areas having a large number of developments and most community areas having relatively few.
The boxplot shows that there are several outliers in the data, with some community areas having significantly more developments than others.
These findings suggest that while there are many affordable housing developments in Chicago, they are not distributed evenly across the city. Some community areas have a much higher concentration of affordable housing than others, which may reflect differences in funding or development priorities.

#Conclusion
In conclusion, my analysis of the Affordable Rental Housing Developments dataset shows that there is significant variation in the distribution of affordable housing developments across community areas in Chicago. This information can be used by policymakers, community organizations, and developers to identify areas with the greatest need for affordable housing and to target resources and initiatives accordingly.
